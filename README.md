# Python codes
 As I attended an AI-Machine Learning Scholarship by Egypt Digital Pioneers Initiative, here is some codes that I implemented with python.
 
 -A Multiplication program by using while condition

 -A program that prints the maximum value of a list without using a built-in function and by using for & if

 -A program that prints the vowel letters and the count of them by using for loop

 -A program that prints a diamond shape with stars by using for loops
